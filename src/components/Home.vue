    <h1>Hello, i'm Victor Vernasqui ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <h2>A Front-end Developer based in Brazil</h2>
    <p>
      Ever since i was 10, i've aways had some sort of contact with computers
      and technology, this has lead me into a rabbit hole of never-ending
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      It all started with gaming. I loved games back then, and still do, and i
      really wanted to know how all of those experiences worked from behind the
      scenes, how the developers were able to put so much love and passion into
      a small Playstation 2 disk. I remember having a computer running Windows
      XP at home, and i used that to try and find answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Years have passed and now i'm even more in love with this world full of
      mysteries, the idea of programming anything i want is simply mind blowing,
      and i want to study the ins and outs of computers.
